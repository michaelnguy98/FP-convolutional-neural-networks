                <h1>Color Channels of an RGB Image</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Normally, images are thought of as being two dimensional. In truth the
                majority of images are actually stored as a grid of pixels where each
                pixel holds channels with the amount of the colors red, blue, and green
                to display. This means that an RGB image can be thought of as 3 dimensional
                with the different color channels making up the layers.
            </p>

                Explore the image below to see how the original image on top is broken
                down into its 3 color channels. Note how the white stripe on the track is
                clearly visible in all 3. This is because white is the result of all the colors
                while black is the absence of them.

            This is important in convolution because it means that instead of having just a single
            kernel for an image there will actually be a kernel for each of those color layers. The
            output is also 3 dimensional unless the dimensionality is reduced through addition of
            the layers.
